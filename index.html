            <p>Hello! I am Brad Herbert and this is about me! I was born and raised in Kannapolis, North Carolina. I
                have always had an interest in sports and music and have and am playing both. I am a family man with a
                wife and two children. We love going to church together and just hang out at the house.</p>
            <p> I am an ordained pastor and currently serve at Hillcrest Church in Charlotte, North Carolina. Just like
                Paul in the bible, I prefer to work outside the church and preach and teach within, though both are work
                in a sense. Well,
                thats enough about me, I don't like to talk about myself but here we are!</p>
