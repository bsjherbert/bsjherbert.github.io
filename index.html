            <p>Hello! My name is Steven Herbert but I go by Brad. I was born in Kannaplolis, North Carolina. I grew up
                playing sports and still love them today. I met my wife in highschool where we were best friends and
                we decided to start dating ten years after we first met, and now we have two beautiful children and a
                thriving marriage.
            </p>

            <p>For the past seven years I have been working in ministry as a pastor and worship leader. My grandfather
                and uncle played bluegrass and country music when I was growing up. I was always
                around music growing up but didn't begin playing myself until 2013. I currently still serve as Associate
                Pastor at Hillcrest Church. </p>

            <p>A lot of the leadership skills I learned in the church are applicable in the workplace.
                I am currently in charge of the disciplship program, and music program at our church which requires
                strong leadership skills, patience and willingness to work well in group environments. </p>
